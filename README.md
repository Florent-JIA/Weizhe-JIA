- Hi, I’m Weizhe.
- I’m a master student at Institut Mines-Télécom Atlantique in France.
- I speak fluently English, French and Chinese.
- My major is Data Science, and I did a lot of research on AI, data analysis and image processing.
- Now I'm working on a project to convert hand drawn sketches into CAD models.I plan to realize it with the combination of a 2D-GAN network and a 3D-GAN network. 
- If you are also interested in those IA topics, especially in the field of image processing and 3D reconstruction, I would be very happy to communicate with you.
